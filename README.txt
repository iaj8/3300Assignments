To open the webpage version of both these projects start a server.

This can most easily be done by typing 

                                          python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

into the Command Line.

For 3300-project-1, go into the folder on the server and click on ÔsrcÕ

For 3300Project2, clicking on the folder within the server is all you need to do.
